An indepedant check of calo gain using the E/p ratio

   - Plot E/p vs t 
   - Plot E/p vs E 
   - Take X profile
   - Cross check with a series of gauss fit to slices in x of the y axis
   - Search different regions 
     	    - Core region about ~1
	    - High flux region about 1.7 GeV

For v9_11_00, gain corrections have be applied. It will probably be flat in both cases.
