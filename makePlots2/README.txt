All gainPlotters basically do the same thing, they take the 2D plots, fit slices and write to a ROOT file

- gainPlotter_time_xtal.C
This is the most important. It takes the 2D E/p vs t plots per xtal 

- gainPlotter_time.C
Does the same thing but per breakout boards

-gainPlotter_energy.C
Makes some example plots of E/p vs t and E vs p
