gainPlotter.C
An indepedant check of calo gain using the E/p ratio

   - Plot E/p vs t 
   - Plot E/p vs E 
   - Take X profile
   - Cross check with a series of gauss fit to slices in x of the y axis
   - Search different regions 
     	    - Core region about ~1
	    - High flux region about 1.7 GeV

- Write all histograms to a root file

For v9_11_00, gain corrections have be applied. 
For 60h_5036B, gain corrections have no been applied. 

gainPlotter2.C 

- Just focus on the high flux and high flux positrons region 

- Improve formatting 

- Write new fitter for the functions 

- Write all histograms to a ROOT file
